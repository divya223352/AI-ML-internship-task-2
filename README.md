# AI-ML-internship-task-2
This task involves Data Preprocessing, where you take raw, "messy" data and clean it. Missing data is harmful because it can lead to biased results or cause code to crash during training. By the end of this task, you will have a complete, high-quality dataset and a notebook documenting your cleaning process.
